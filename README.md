This was a practice project when I was an intern at Ulka Games Ltd.
I created it with my 1 month of knowledge in August 2020. This is completely a mess and horrible. But, worked hard to maintain the scale and animation in 2D but in **World Space** Canvas. This is crazy. I didn't know about the **Screen Space** Canvas then.
